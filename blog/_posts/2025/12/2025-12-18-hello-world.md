Welcome to my shiny new personal website and blog!

## About The Site
Most of my site is my own work. Over winter break, I needed a way to keep busy, so I thought, *why not launch a website?* I got to work and built a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)-based theme on top of the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) content management system. The source code is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/RichardLamb1/RichardLamb.dev).

Additionally, I use a few extra libraries as listed below. Thank you to all who contributed as my site would not be possible without them.
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
- [Animate on Scroll (AOS)](https://github.com/michalsnik/aos)
- [Lunr Search](https://lunrjs.com/)
- [Giscus (comments)](https://giscus.app/)
- [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/)

## What's To Come

I'm currently working on a few posts that I'll publish over the winter break. For now though, feel free to browse through the site and check out all the pages.

## Closing Thoughts

As I said earlier, this site is mostly a product of my own individual work. If you run into any issues or have any suggestions, please feel free to drop them down in the comments or [contact me](/contact) as you see fit. If you're commenting about a bug or technical issue with the site, including what browser and device/OS you're using would be helpful.

Welp, guess that's all for now. Be sure to come back soon for more new posts, and thanks for visiting!
